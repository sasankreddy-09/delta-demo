Descendent Selector
Eg:: selects all paragraphs inside divs
<!-- div p{
    property:value;selects all the paragraphs in div tag
}-->
ADJACENT SIBLING COMBINATOR 
HEADING 3 THAT COMES IMMEDIATELY AFTER ANY paragraphs
P+H3{
    property:value;
}
"+"-->adjacent COMBINATOR
CHILD COMBINATOR::
selects all buttons which are directly children of spans
ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR:
selects the elements based on the presence or value of a given ATTRIBUTE
input[attr="value"]{
    property:value;
}
PSUEDO CLASS::
A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements
:hover
:active
:checked
:nth-of-type-->to change the n elements at a time 
specificity



PSEUDO element:::
A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected elements
::first-letter(we can use singe colon also it works but it is not correct)
::first-line
::selection(it comes to use when we select a    color:darkgreen
ny paragraph)



SELECTOR specificity
What is specificity????
specificity is an algorithm that caluculates the weight that is applied to a given css declaration 
id >class,attribute,psudeo-class>element and psudeo-element
these are hundred place , tenth place, ones place it is like mathematics
if specificity is same casscading is used 
""""""" inline is the highest prioritized other than any thing """""""


!important 
when we want to give the highest priority so that cannot be 
changed by any thing inline is also lesser than the importnat
 "" but it is not used mostly"" 




"" inheritence ""
if we write div ,p and li in one after the other 
div is the parent and p and li are childrens 
if we apply any color to the div tag it will apply to the p and li also 
it is called inheritence 
input tag doesnt inherit any property 

"color pallet"

NOTE:width height border some others are not inherited

--- important--- 
box in css
margin is used to give the space between the two boxes
** margin:0,auto; here auto gives the same margin space from left and right
border is used to give the border of the given element
HEIGHT
by default it sets the content area height of the element


Inline and block elements there some important points to remember for more information refer the pdf 


in inline elements There is no height and width in for example inline doesnt apply any 
block property but inline-block is one of the property it can be used to apply the block property 
and behave like inline objects

PERCENTAGE***UNITS:
IT is often used to define a size as relative to an elements parent object.
eg:: width :33.33% // relative to the parent
it is realtive to the parent height and width
div has inner div

Relative units:
em ( pronounced as m )
Font size of the parent , in case of typographical properties like font-size and font size of the elment itself
in case of other properties like width
text related properties is also called typographical 




******CSS Next Steps ********
Alpha channel 
sets the opacity for a color 
ranges from 0 to 1
it tells the how much does the color appear 
eg:-rgba(0,255,0,0.3)
aplha=0.3 in above we can set 0.43 also in points
hexa decmial also has alpha value 
example #4dff00ff   00-->ff


opacity ::
it is used to set the opacity of the element unlike alpha 
Ranges from 0 to 1
